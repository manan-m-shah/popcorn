## Inspiration

-   Movies are seen by billions but produced by ahandful. Movies and other media contents have paved way for many changes in society and we believe that the choice of funding something so impactful and integral to everyone should not be left to a centralised identity.
-   Some Amazing content might have just died with "the thinker" cause they didnt have a backer. We want people to back such amazing contents and thinkers.
-   Content creation is the new "startups" so there needs to be a funding platform for that as well. <br>

<br><br>

## Who is it for?

Our Dapp caters to all three facets of content creation: <br>

-   The creater of content: One who uploads the video on livepeer (video streaming platform).
-   The Stakeholders: One who is sure of the creater and the project idea. These stakeholders stake their crypto in exchange for a percentage of ownership of the content.
-   The audience: One who consumes the content in exchange for some ticket fee.

## The Process in high level

-   *The Creater* announces their upcoming content, with a description and/or a trailer.
-   *The stakers* are people who believe in the creater/idea and decide to back them by staking some funds. They aquire some part of ownership for the upcoming content. This also builds hype around the content.
-   *The Creater* realeses their content on our platform.
-   *The audience* buy tickets, in the form of ERC-721 NFTs, for watching the content.
-   These tickets generates profit which is then divided among the stakeholders based on their percentage ownership.

## ETHIndia Partners who helped our decentralisation

### Livepeer

The content is streamed by decentralised streaming protocol, livepeer.

### Moonbeam

We deployed our smart contract on moonbeam, a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications. We also deployed the contract on goerli ETH testnet.

### Push protocol

Push Protocol is a web3 communication network, enabling cross-chain notifications. It notifies the other chain when a new content is added to the current one.

### StackOS

we used stackOS infrastructure for deployment of our web application.

## Detailed rundown for the geeks

1. We built our frontend in NextJS. 
2. The home page contains a netflix like collection of trending and upcoming movies. On clicking any of these movie cards, one gets transferred to the individual movie's page.
3. One can add a new movie to the site by first posting the movie on Livepeer studio and getting its playback ID. This ID can then be put on our site. 
The movie page contains all the details about the movie.
4. There are also options to stake your money on the project and playing the trailer/full-movie for unrealeased and relased movies respectively.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

On running into all the challenges mentioned above, we read relavant articles, documentations and other literature. We had some amazing mentors to help us whenerver thanks to ETHIndia. With our past knowledge and present improvisations, we were able to put forward *our project*. Here's some things we are proud of.

### Coming up with an idea

To come up with a simple yet useful idea among the many talks and workshops, and to build upon it by using the softwares of sponsors was an ardous task in itself, and we are proud to stick to something and build it.

### Built from scratch

YES. we built the whole thing in a day and a half with no prior advances on the idea before the event whatsoever. Infact we came up with idea after talking to many of the ETHIndia sponsors/mentors. Thanks ya'll!

### UI/UX Design

Web3 has been the difficult and techy guy in the room for far too long. So we designed a web solution that is more intuitive to use,and interact with, for users belonging to both technical and non-technical backgrounds. <br>

### Integrating blockchain with web2

The integration of web3 is a tough nut and building this, took a long time of reading documentation and discussing with the sponsor teams.

### Code Blooded

We coded day and night and day and night. Yes we did. Huge cheer out to the recharge station's hot tea(food n drinks stall) without whom it wouldn't have been posssible.

## Tech Stack Used

1. Solidity for writing smart contracts.
2. NextJS for building the front-end of the application.
3. web3.js for integrating the contracts with the front-end.
4. Protocols like Push and StackOS are used.


## What we learnt through this hackathon

-   Efficient team-work and iterative developement in a fast paced environment.
-   Worked with a team of developers and UI designers.
